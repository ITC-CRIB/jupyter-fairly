# JupyterFAIR
 A jupyterLab extension for seamless integration of Jupyter-based research environments and research data repositories.

## Set up Dev Environment

1. Create a conda environment with
    ```shell
    conda create -n jupyterfair --override-channels --strict-channel-priority -c conda-forge -c nodefaults jupyterlab=3 cookiecutter nodejs jupyter-packaging git
    ```
2. Clone repository
3. Activate conda environment
4. Create a `.env` file in  the `jupyterfair/jupyterfair/` subfolder, and add a TOKEN (for now only 4TU personal tokens). Such as:
   ```
   TOKEN="Bearer <token-hash>"
   ```
5. Install, activate and build extension
    ```shell
    # Install package in development mode
    pip install -e .
    # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
    jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
    # Enable the server extension
    jupyter server extension enable jupyterfair
    # Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
    jlpm run build
    ```
6. On a new terminal, start the Jupyter Server
   ```shell
   jupyter server
   ```
7. Open the link in the terminal in a browser. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/jupyterfair/get_example`. You should see the following message:
   ```json
   {"data": "This is /jupyterfair/get_test endpoint... Hoora! It works!!!"}
   ```

    > You will need to re-build the extension with `jlpm run build` and re-start **jupyter server** for changes to the soruce code take effect.
